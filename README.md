# Securing-a-Business-Network
In this project, I apply the skills I have acquired in the cybersecurity fundamentals course by conducting a hands-on security assessment based on a common business problem. I investigate and fix security issues on a Windows 10 client system as a way of demonstrating fundamental cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and abilities.
